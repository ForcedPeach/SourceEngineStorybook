This is a Source Engine 1 modification of the 2013 single player branch.

This mod is built on top of the MapBase mod by Blixibon and incorporates other quality of life improvements.

Goals:
* Provide a mod that people wanting to make single player maps can map for without having to setup their own single player mod
* Provide an easy way to share maps and content the maps use
* Provide an example Mapbase mod
* Provide a version of Mapbase that can be forked into a seperate mod if someone wants their map(s) to be have a standalone launcher
* Provide quality of life improvements
* Provide gameplay changes that can be opted into
